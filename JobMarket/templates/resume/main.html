			<p>“The elevator to success is out of order. You’ll have to use the stairs, one step at a time.” Joe Girard</p>
			<p>“I didn’t fail the test. I just found 100 ways to do it wrong.” Benjamin Franklin</p>

			<p>Your limitation—it’s only your imagination.</p>
			<p>Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.</p>
			<p>Success doesn’t just find you. You have to go out and get it.</p>
			<p>The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.</p>
			<p>Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.</p>
			<p>It’s going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we’re tested not to show our weaknesses, but to discover our strengths.</p>
			<p>The key to success is to focus on goals, not obstacles.</p>
